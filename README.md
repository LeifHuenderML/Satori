# Satori: The Go-Playing Robot

Welcome to the official repository for **Satori**, the physical embodiment of the AI "Kitsune". Satori is not just a robot; it's a culmination of advanced technology and creative engineering, designed to play the ancient and intellectually demanding game of Go on a standard 19 x 19 game board.

## Overview

Satori leverages the power of machine vision and a suite of other cutting-edge technologies to interact with and play Go. This repository is your hub for all things Satori, including:

- ðŸ¤– **Robot Design Files**: Detailed schematics and designs of Satori.
- ðŸ§  **AI 'Kitsune' Code**: The brain behind Satori, an AI trained to play Go.
- ðŸ“š **Documentation**: In-depth documentation on how Satori works, from its AI algorithms to its mechanical design.
- ðŸŽ¥ **Demo Videos**: Watch Satori in action, playing Go.

## Features

- **Machine Vision**: Advanced algorithms that enable Satori to understand and interact with the physical Go board.
- **Strategic Gameplay**: The AI 'Kitsune' is trained to not only play Go but to challenge and adapt to various playing styles.
- **Physical Interaction**: Precisely engineered to move pieces on a standard Go board with accuracy and care.
- **Open Source**: Dive into the code, schematics, and documentation to learn and contribute.
